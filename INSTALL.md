Starting a new Dev project - Setup guide

Follow these steps to setup your new LAMP development project:

    1. Download virtualBox for your platform from here
        On *nix systems (Mac OSX, Linux, etc), you will need to modify your .bash_profile (or .zsh_profile) to extend your $PATH variable: 
    PATH=$PATH:/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/
    export PATH

    2. Download vagrant for your platform from here
        On *nix systems (Mac OSX, Linux, etc), you will need to use "wget" command to get the file and then install it.
        For example, you will need to: 
   $$ ####CentOS
   $$ cd /tmp
   $$ sudo wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.6.3_x86_64.rpm
   $$ sudo rpm -i vagrant_1.6.3_x86_64.rpm
   $$ ####Ubuntu
   $$ cd /tmp
   $$ sudo wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.6.3_x86_64.deb
   $$ dpkg -i vagrant_1.6.3_x86_64.deb

    3. There is a list of available virtualbox instances you can choose from here. For this example i am choosing an Ubuntu 12.04 box and provisioning it with the latest apache,mysql and php: 

   $$ git clone git@box64.int.nyulaw.me:infrastructure/vagrant-lamp-with-salt.git
   $$ ####Do "git checkout hyperv" after you clone for the hyperv setup
   $$ ####Just note that on hyperv, NAT is not supported and you need to choose external in network settings
   $$ cd vagrant-lamp-with-salt
   $$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-salt
   $$ ####If you get are on windows and you get the error :   H:/ <errno::ENOENT>
   $$ ####just set your HOME this way on the terminal: SET HOME=%USERPROFILE%
   $$ ####and run the command again
   $$ ####start your vm:
   $$ vagrant up
   $$ ####Please allow for some time for your vm to be provisioned
   $$ 

    4. Your box is now running. You can get into this instance to do your own configuration, via SSH: 

   $$ vagrant ssh

Go to http://localhost:8080 and you should see the apache webserver default page, and also the phpinfo page: http://localhost:8080/phpinfo.php
